# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning with XAI

## Project Description
This project predicts the risk of heart disease using multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are used to interpret the model predictions and identify important clinical features.
